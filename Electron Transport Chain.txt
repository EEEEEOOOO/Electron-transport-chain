Electron transport chain
* Inner mitochondrial membrane
* Extract energy from electron carrier
* Transfer electrons from NADH and FADH2 to O2
* Consists of 4 protein complex
   * Complex I: NADH dehydrogenase
   * Complex II: Succinate dehydrogenase (single peripheral)
   * Complex III: Cytochrome Complex
   * Complex IV: Cytochrome Oxidase

Electron transfer controlled by 2 electron shuttle
* Ubiquinone(UQ)
* Cytochrome(cyt c)

What drives the ETC
* I, III, IV are protein 
   * Increase negativity from I→III→IV
* Complex has cofactors that alternate between reduced and oxidized states
   * As complexes pull electrons from upstream complexes and donate electrons to more electronegative downstream.
   * Not proteins themselves pull electrons but their non-protein groups that bonds to protein.
* ETC is final destination of oxygen
* Oxygen goes into the mitochondria with the single task of pulling the electrons away from complex IV
* The strongest electronegativity drives entire ETC
——————————————————————————————————————————
When oxygen interacts with complex IV
* It removes a pair of electrons, it will also reacts with two protons(2H+) from matrix
   * Form a single H2O
* For O2 
   * It need 4 electrons and 4 H+ to form 2 H2O
* The chain reaction is almost instantaneous

Free energy
* Upstream is greatest amount
* Downstream is lowest amount
* Electrons in NADH has most free energy
* Oxygen has the strongest electronegative, it has a strong hold on its bond, therefore the electrons have less free energy.
* Electrons release free energy as they are pulled by stronger and stronger oxidizing complexes
